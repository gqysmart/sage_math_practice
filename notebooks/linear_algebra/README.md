# Notebooks — Learning System Overview

This folder contains all Jupyter notebooks used for learning
Linear Algebra, Probability, and Machine Learning.

The learning method follows a dual-language approach:

- English → Understanding (4-step method)
- French  → Expression & exam-ready summaries (3-step method)
- Jupyter → Experiments & visual intuition

## 🧠 Learning Method

### 1. 4-step method (EN — Thinking layer)

Used only for understanding:

- What is it?
- Why do we need it?
- How does it work?
- When does it fail?

This section may be informal and written in English.
Its goal is clarity, not presentation.

---

### 2. 3-step summary (FR — Expression layer)

Used for exams, assignments, and structured revision:

- Concept
- Principe (mécanisme)
- Applications / Limites

This section is written in French and follows academic style.

---

### 3. Experiments (Python / Sage / NumPy)

Minimal code examples are included to:
- validate intuition,
- visualize results,
- observe failure cases.
