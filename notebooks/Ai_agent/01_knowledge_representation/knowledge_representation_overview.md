# Knowledge Representation -- Overview

Knowledge representation (KR) is concerned with how an intelligient system formally describes the world so that reasoning, planning, learning can be performed.
In other words,
KR provides a static, declarative description of the world, including:

- entities
- relations
- properties
- facts
- rules and constraints

Dynamic behavior arises only when this representation is used in problem formulations involving actions, transitions, and time.
