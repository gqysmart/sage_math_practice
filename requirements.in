# Sagework - requirements.in
# Purpose: notebooks + scientific computing + classical ML
# Notes:
# - Keep this file minimal; pin versions in requirements.txt via pip-tools.
# - If you use SageMath's bundled Python/kernel, do NOT pip install into it.
#   Instead, use a project venv (.venv) and register an ipykernel.
